## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I built this just using W3Schools, MDN docs and trial & error. It went pretty well. Below are some of the things I learned building this component:

1. How to round corners using border-radius.
2. I needed to center the card vertically and horizontally and I tried a few methods and finally landed on using Grid with justify-items and align-items.
3. When I finished the desktop view I realized that my mobile version was smaller than the design image so I learned to use a media query to increase the width of the card and the padding around the text.
4. After the fact I learned about mobile-first development which I will use in my next project.

### Continued development

1. I want to use custom CSS variables so I keep the fonts and colors organized and easier to use. I didn't think of using them at the beginning of this project but I want to use them in my next one.
2. Use mobile-first process next time.
